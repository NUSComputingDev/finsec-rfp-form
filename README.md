# Finity
Internal RFP and claims submission form maintained by Finance Secretariat. 

## What
This repo contains the source code for the FinSec RFP Claims Processing form called `Finity`. It's an internal tool used to ensure documents are in the right format to be sent to the NUS School of Computing finance department for claims processing.

The 24th Management Committee Finance Secretariat uses a `S.U.R.E.` approach to claims processing. It's used to submit claims to NUS SOC Finance **7 days** in advance. 

The web application contains detailed descriptions of the process. It fully automates the following `S.U.R.E` process such that users _only_ need to submit the documents. A report is generated automatically and sent to the Finance Secretariat behind the scenes after submission.

## S.U.R.E.
### `S`upporting Documents
These documents encompass the following expense categories that need to be prepared before submitting the form:

- Receipt / Invoice / Unpaid receipts *
- Transport claims
- Prizes for events (acknowledgement from recipient with misc. details)
- Reimbursement acknowledgement letter (for online purchases)

> \* represents required paperwork. 

### `U`ploading
Once the above documents have been prepared, the next step is to upload the documents to the internal 24th MC Google Drive at the following path:

```
Common > Finance > Reimbursement Process > RFP Supporting Documents Scanned Archive
```

### `R`FP Form
There's a PDF template form that needs to be filled by the claim applicant. The supporting documenst from `S` need to be attached together with this RFP PDF form. 

### `E`mailing
The final step is to send the combined PDF of the RFP form and the supporting documents to `finance@nuscomputing.com`.
